> JavaScript training

This project is made in classical style - separate functional modules, built with **gulp**. 
 I worked with the ready layout.
 
The site has such functionalities:
- modal windows 
- slider
- forms
- phone number mask
- upload data from the database - add additional blocks (by clicking on 'Посмотреть больше стилей' button)
- total cost calculator
- tabs (filtering elements on the page)
- block where the images are replaced when you point at them.
- accordion
- burger menu
- soft scroll button
- Drag & Drop image upload

The project is  **validated**  without errors and warnings, all  **images are optimized**. The site is **adaptive** for mobile phone, tablet and desktop.
